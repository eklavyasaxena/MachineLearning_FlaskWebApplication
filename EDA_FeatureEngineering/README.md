## Topic:
Customer Retention Analysis
|Data Engineering & Prediction Models|


## Summary:
Cutomer retention mainly depends on how loyal your customers are and how willing 
they are to keep buying your services. This can be evaluated by effective analysis 
of the customers data. Our goal for this part of the project is to explore the dataset 
of customers of a Telecommunication firm with implementing various prediction models and
to come up with an accurate model with high efficiency.


## Introduction:
This part of project consists of various elements of Machine learning.
Following are the contents:

>1. Exploratory Data Analysis| Conduct EDA using Python libraries (plotly, seaborn, matplotlib etc.)|
>2. Feature Engineering | Conduct thorough feature analysis and use pre-processing techniques to make the data usable. |
>3. Feature Selection | Understand the importance of the various features and how the features influence the output. Try Boruta Library for selecting features.|
>4. Prediction Algorithms | Try Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNeighbor and Decision Tree to build prediction models in using sklearn in Python. Compute accuracy Score for Training and Testing Datasets. Recommend a model.
>5. Serialization | Used pickle to serialize the models.
